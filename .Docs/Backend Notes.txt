- Created new branch from VSCode using: git checkout -b backend-v3
- Ran git merge master to pull same master files as JeanMarie has in her project
- Renamed editorback-v2 to reflect that it is not usable and has no changes in it;

- Recloned full repo and ran yarn, then merged with master to confirm that back and front
ends are using the same files and getting the same pages; Editor is running, ready to connect Auth;
- Migrated updates to User for Auth; updated Routes.tsx with <Private> tags
